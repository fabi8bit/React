### Updating state

- Add the onClick attribute to the button
- Write an event handler to listen for the click event
- use setState() in the event handler to update the state

#### attention:
- setState() is asynchronous. To run something only after the State is complete we need to place the code in a callback function as the second parameter of the setState
